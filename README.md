## Overview

I had a lot of fun making the design required with the assets given, and
this project may have helped me the most with developing my design skills.

It took approximately 15 hours total, and helped me learn some topics with
Javascript as well, such as:
For loops,
Functions invoking functions,
Conditionals,
Event listeners,
and a couple of small tricks to get things up and running.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

First, I started with all of the html and css; designing everything to look responsive
And then I added some functionality, such as hoverables and interaction with buttons and dropdowns.

I aimed to only spend a couple of days on this project, however it took me approximately 15-20 hours to learn everything I needed.

### What I learned

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript
